    "body": "<p>When Lincune 29, 2023, the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions in cases involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The decision unleashed a firestorm of outrage and debate among progressives and liberals. At the same time, many conservatives heralded the decision as a step in the right direction. Liberals claimed this was a blow to the efforts of racial and social justice in America and therefore declaimed it as racist. Conservatives saw it as an attack on race-based decision-making and, therefore, anti-racist. The two reactions, however, as opposite as they may seem, rely on the same logic — the logic of identity politics. A month earlier, conservatives were in an uproar over the casting of black actress Halle Bailey as the main character, Ariel, in Disney’s remake of The Little Mermaid. Progressives championed this casting decision as insurgent and part of a larger social justice movement to make media more diverse.<p>"
